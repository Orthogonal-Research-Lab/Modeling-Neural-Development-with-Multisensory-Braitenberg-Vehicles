Some initial materials created for this project.

*odor.csv* is a small dataset of common chemicals, their odors, and legal limit. *odor_EDA* is an attempt of exploratory data analysis on it. 

*Designed relations among abstract odors, tastes, and preference* is one simple way I thought of to represent stimuli. It can be a starting point. 

*neural_network* is a simple neural network that I am currently mainly working on, and *simple_neural_network_animation* is a script for animating the neural_network class. An example:

This neural network actually only has sensory receptors, olfaction and gustation. Olfactory stimuli can be sensed from any distance, but gustatory stimuli can only be sensed within a circle around a stimulus source.
