Some initial materials created for this project.

*odor.csv* is a small dataset of common chemicals, their odors, and legal limit. *odor_EDA* is an attempt of exploratory data analysis on it. 

*Designed relations among abstract odors, tastes, and preference* is one simple way I thought of to represent stimuli. It can be a starting point. 

*simple_neural_network* is a simple neural network that I am currently mainly working on.
