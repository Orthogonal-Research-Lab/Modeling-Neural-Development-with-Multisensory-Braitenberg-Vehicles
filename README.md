# Modeling Neural Development with Multisensory Braitenberg Vehicles
The project is to create a robust and efficient simulation of Hebbian neural development among olfactory system, gustatory system, and interneurons during reinforcement and other cognition processes. The implementation utilizes SimBrain GUI and other Python-based APIs.
